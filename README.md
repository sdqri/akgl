# My OpenGL Learning Playground

This repository is my personal playground for learning OpenGL using the C programming language. It contains basic examples and experiments aimed at understanding OpenGL concepts.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find:

- `main.c`: Entry point of my OpenGL learning experiments.
- `glad.c`: Library for loading OpenGL.
- `shader/shader.c`: Code for handling shaders.
- `mesh/mesh.c`: Functions related to mesh operations.

This repository is primarily for my learning purposes and may not be directly useful for others.

## Getting Started

To explore and experiment with this project, you'll need:

- **OpenGL Development Libraries:** Ensure you have the necessary OpenGL development libraries installed on your system.
- **CMake:** Use CMake to generate the build files.

Follow these steps:

- Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/opengl-learning-playground.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
    cd akgl
```

- Create a build directory and generate build files using CMake:
```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
```

- Build the project:
```bash
    cmake --build .
```

- Run the executable:
```bash
    ./akgl 
```
